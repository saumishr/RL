# launch_rlvr_sc_nvcf_disagg.sh
#
# Submits the all-features arm of the Nemotron 3.5 Nano Amplified Dolphin RLVR
# study: SingleController with streaming train, the ready_first sampler at a
# staleness window of 1, judges hosted on NVCF, ns_tools sandboxes on a remote
# OpenSandbox pool, rollouts over CPU RDMA, and nccl_reshard refit.
#
# The training semantics live in rlvr_sc_nvcf_disagg.yaml. This wrapper only
# switches the deployment: which judges are hosted, where sandboxes come from,
# and the node split those two choices imply. It sets no site paths -- pass
# MODEL_PATH, TRAIN_PATH, VAL_PATH, CONTAINER, PERSISTENT_CACHE, SLURM_ACCOUNT
# and SLURM_PARTITION as you would to nano35_launch.sh, which validates them.
#
# Usage:
#
#   set -a; source /path/to/creds.env; set +a   # see "Credentials" below
#   EXP_NAME=nano35-allfeatures \
#   MODEL_PATH=... TRAIN_PATH=... VAL_PATH=... \
#   CONTAINER=... PERSISTENT_CACHE=... \
#   SLURM_ACCOUNT=... SLURM_PARTITION=batch \
#   bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3.5-nano/launch_rlvr_sc_nvcf_disagg.sh
#
# Hydra overrides are forwarded verbatim, so a cheap smoke run is:
#
#   EXP_NAME=allfeatures-smoke NUM_TRAIN_NODES=4 NUM_GEN_NODES=2 NUM_GYM_NODES=2 \
#   NS_SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE=8 NRL_MAX_STEPS=2 WALLTIME=02:00:00 \
#   bash .../launch_rlvr_sc_nvcf_disagg.sh \
#     grpo.num_prompts_per_step=8 policy.train_global_batch_size=128 \
#     async_rl.min_groups_for_streaming_train=2 async_rl.max_inflight_prompts=16 \
#     async_rl.max_buffered_rollouts=16
#
# Note the last three: at a reduced prompt count the inherited 1024-slot buffers
# are far past what admission can reach, and min_groups_for_streaming_train must
# come down or a step never accumulates enough groups to train on.
#
# Credentials (export before running; every one is read inside the job, not
# baked into the submission):
#
#   NVIDIA_API_KEY        NVCF key. The config carries ${oc.env:NVIDIA_API_KEY}
#                         for all three judges, resolved in-container.
#   OPENSANDBOX_BASE_URL  Sandbox control plane, read by Gym's ns_tools.yaml.
#   OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY   Its key, likewise.
#   NS_SANDBOX_IMAGE      Sandbox image. Required even with a pool_ref: pods
#                         claimed from the pool template use it, and selecting
#                         the sandbox_pool backend with an empty image is a hard
#                         startup error rather than a fallback.
#   WANDB_API_KEY         Optional; absent disables W&B.
#   HF_TOKEN              Optional.
#
# These reach the job the same way WANDB_API_KEY always has: exported at submit
# time, inherited by every srun ray.sub launches, so gym actors on remote nodes
# see them too. ray.sub redacts *API_KEY* / *TOKEN* from its env dumps.
#
# Pool contract (nothing here touches the pool -- run these yourself):
#
#   Before submitting, raise the warm pool to cover the claim and confirm it is
#   warm, because a cold pool with pool_fallback=false fails slots rather than
#   creating pods on demand:
#
#     kubectl -n opensandbox patch pools.sandbox.opensandbox.io ${NS_SANDBOX_POOL_REF:-<pool>} \
#       --type merge -p '{"spec":{"capacitySpec":{"poolMin":<>=size>}}}'
#     kubectl -n opensandbox get pools.sandbox.opensandbox.io ${NS_SANDBOX_POOL_REF:-<pool>} \
#       -o jsonpath='{.status}{"\n"}'
#
#   The pool is shared, so size NS_SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE to what the run needs.
#   Afterwards reap claims by run label and drop poolMin back:
#
#     kubectl -n opensandbox delete bsbx \
#       -l "nemo-gym.nvidia.com/run=<NEMO_GYM_RUN_ID>" --wait=false
#
# Optional knobs (all defaulted below): NS_SANDBOX_POOL_REF,
# NS_SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE, NS_SANDBOX_POOL_FALLBACK, NS_SANDBOX_TTL_S,
# NEMO_GYM_RUN_ID, plus everything nano35_launch.sh accepts.
#
#   DISAGG_SANDBOX=1      0 keeps the NVCF judges but returns ns_tools to the
#                         per-node sidecar. Use it when comparing throughput
#                         against the local-judge arm, so judge placement is the
#                         only variable; the shared warm pool is a second one,
#                         and not one this launcher can hold constant. At 0 the
#                         OPENSANDBOX_* and NS_SANDBOX_* requirements above are
#                         dropped and SANDBOX_CONTAINER becomes required.

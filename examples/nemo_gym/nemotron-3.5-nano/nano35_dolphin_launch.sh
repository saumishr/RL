# Nemotron 3.5 Nano — RLVR, legacy async-1, honest-dolphin warm start.
# Reproduces the internal reference run
#   geshen-ultra-rl-nano-honest-dolphin-v10-iter6000-mopd-rlvr
# (launch_nano_honest_dolphin.sh + grpo_ultra_512n4g_bf16.yaml on
#  nemo-rl-internal @ 97c55ee2) on public NeMo-RL main.
#
# This is a thin wrapper over examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh.
# That launcher is fully parameterised and already handles code snapshotting,
# persistent-cache seeding, container mounts, Ray/Gym orchestration, and the
# OccupiedIdleGPUsJobReaper --comment exemption — so we set environment and
# delegate rather than forking 800+ lines.
#
# Usage. Judges run one of two ways; see the GenRM section below for the
# trade-off between them.
#
#   Against a warm out-of-band GenRM pool (default; must already be serving):
#     GENRM_BASE_URL=http://<lb-host>:9213/v1 \
#       bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3.5-nano/nano35_dolphin_launch.sh
#
#   Hosting GenRM and the NL2Bash judge inside the job, as the 6K recipe does:
#     EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1 \
#       bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3.5-nano/nano35_dolphin_launch.sh

# GenRM hosting. Two shapes, and this recipe supports both.
#
# EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1 is the 6K shape: GenRM and the NL2Bash judge are
# co-scheduled in a second Slurm hetgroup inside this job. The allocation
# wrapper brings up every replica plus one load balancer per pool, waits for
# health, then substitutes the resolved URLs into the driver command. The job
# owns its judges, so the reward model lands in provenance and no run can
# outlive, mismatch, or be starved by a pool it does not control.
#
# EXTERNAL_JUDGES=0 (default) keeps GenRM on a separately managed warm pool
# reached through GENRM_BASE_URL, and leaves the NL2Bash judge in the Gym pool.
# Partition `batch` caps at 4 h, so a warm pool amortizes the 470 GB bf16
# Qwen3-235B load across a whole chain of jobs. The in-job path instead pays
# that load once per job — about ten minutes before training starts, measured
# on the 6K run — in exchange for being self-contained.
#
# To stand up the out-of-band pool (copy the dir first — it holds .lb_pid_*,
# logs/ and a flock'd registry, so running someone else's in place collides):
#
#   cp -r /lustre/fs1/portfolios/llmservice/projects/llmservice_modelalignment_ppo/\
# users/geshen/mopd_nano_fast/genrm_serving  <your-dir>/genrm_serving

# Each worker is 2 nodes x 4 GPUs at TP=8, separate from this job's 64 nodes.
#
# The `model` field must equal the pool's --served-model-name ("model" in
# genrm_worker.sh). ultra_launch.sh sets base_url XOR model, never both, so the

# attempts, on different nodes each time (nvl72133-T01, nvl72141-T07,
# nvl72126-T05/T17) — node exclusion cannot fix it.

# Only three Gym servers use the sandbox: competitive_coding_challenges (not in

# config_paths and are LEFT THERE deliberately: they construct their sandbox
# client lazily (math_formal_lean/app.py:387 builds it, :444 uses it inside a

# boot fine without a sandbox and only contact it if a request routes to them.

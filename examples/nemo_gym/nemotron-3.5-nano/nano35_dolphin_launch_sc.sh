# nano35_dolphin_launch_sc.sh
#
# SingleController variant of nano35_dolphin_launch.sh: the same 64-node
# Nemotron 3.5 Nano RLVR pipeclean, driven by run_grpo_single_controller.py
# with streaming forward/backward, the TransferQueue data plane and
# shard-to-shard NCCL-reshard weight refit.
#
# Shape (GB200, 4 GPUs/node -> 256 GPUs), unchanged from the baseline so the
# two runs are comparable:
#   8 train + 40 generation + 16 gym = 64 nodes  (5:1 generation-to-training)
# GenRM adds 4 nodes from its own allocation, so the campaign footprint is 68.
#
# This is a thin wrapper over nano35_dolphin_launch.sh, which already carries
# every site default (model, blend, judges, container, mounts, caches, Slurm).
# We only swap the config and the driver, so the two runs differ solely in the
# SC wiring.
#
# NO CHECKPOINTING. The SC path raises if checkpointing.enabled is true, so the
# run cannot resume across the wall clock and the baseline's singleton
# auto-resume buys nothing here. Size NRL_MAX_STEPS to fit the 4 h allocation.

# GenRM must already be serving — see the GenRM section of the baseline script
# for how to stand up the external pool, or pass EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1 to host
# GenRM and the NL2Bash judge in a hetgroup inside this job instead, which is
# the shape the 6K recipe uses.

#   MAX_LOOKAHEAD_VERSIONS=4     # the sampler's slack, whatever it spells it
#                                # 1 restores parity with the async-1 baseline

# Which selection policy the slack above configures. The samplers spell it
# differently — in_order counts dispatch batches of lookahead, ready_first and
# windowed count weight versions of staleness — and every sampler config is
# extra="allow", so passing the wrong key is accepted and silently ignored,
# leaving that arm sitting at the default of 1. Emitting only the key that
# matches SAMPLER is what stops a sweep from quietly running four copies of the
# same configuration; tests/unit/single_controller/test_sampler_interface.py
# pins the footgun so the launcher and the schema cannot drift apart.
#
# rlvr_dolphin_sc.yaml now declares the ready_first block, so ready_first and
# windowed override their key in place while in_order has to add its own. Hydra
# runs in struct mode: `+` on a key that already exists is an error, and a plain
# override of one that does not is also an error, so these forms are not
# interchangeable. Keys belonging to the samplers not chosen stay in the dict
# and are inert — every config accepts extras — but they do show up in the
# resolved config, so read `name` first when checking an arm.

# permits out of the same pool that admission draws from, so the finished work
# crowds out new generation -- the fix for eviction creates a throughput
# problem one layer down.

# A multiplier above 1 gives retention its own headroom, which is what v1 does:
# late_arrival_slack=2 sizes its retention at P*lag*2 against a generation quota

# Nemotron 3.5 Nano — 8-node SingleController pipeclean
#
# Scaled-down nano35_dolphin_launch_sc.sh for validating the stack end to end
# before spending a 68-node allocation: SingleController, the TransferQueue
# data plane, nccl_reshard refit with MTP-head gating, and the in-job judge
# hetgroup this recipe gained from the 6K side.
#
# Usage:
#   bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3.5-nano/nano35_dolphin_launch_sc_smoke.sh
#   DRY_RUN=1 bash .../nano35_dolphin_launch_sc_smoke.sh        # inspect only
#
# Training parallelism is deliberately NOT scaled. Four nodes is the floor that
# preserves it exactly: TP=4 x CP=4 x PP=1 fills 16 GPUs, and EP=8 still divides
# 16 at ETP=1, so every rank owns the same 16 of the 128 routed experts as the
# full-scale run. The only difference is DP, which drops from 2 to 1.
# Going to 2 training nodes would force CP below 4, and CP=4 is what makes the
# 73728-token context tractable, so the comparison would stop being meaningful.
#
# Sequence length is left at the production 73728 on purpose. Truncating it
# would risk failures in the blend rather than in the code under test, and
# generation length is bounded by EOS in practice, not by the cap.
#
# What gets scaled instead is the cohort, from 128 prompts to 8, and the step
# count. NRL_MAX_STEPS must stay >= 2: the first weight sync only happens
# between steps, and refit is the main thing this run exists to exercise.
#
# The default shape is 8 nodes total. Raise NUM_GEN_NODES / NUM_GYM_NODES to 2
# each (10 nodes) if rollouts are throughput-bound or Gym's env servers are
# cramped on a single node.
